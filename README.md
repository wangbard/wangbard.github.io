# My Personal Blog

Welcome to the repository for my personal blog, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This site is a place where I share insights on topics I find interesting.

## Credits

The blog is powered by the amazing [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), which provides a clean, responsive, and customizable layout.

Feel free to explore the code and content here. If you're interested in the theme itself, be sure to check out [Chirpy's GitHub repository](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).
