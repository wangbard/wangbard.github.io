My name is **Mingrui Zou**, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity at The University of Edinburgh. My thesis focuses on secure multiparty computation (MPC) combiners under the supervision of Dr. Michele Ciampi. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at The University of Edinburgh, where my undergraduate thesis, supervised by Chris Heunen and Robin Kaarsgaard, examined the topic of quantum information effects. My academic journey has led me to explore the intersection of quantum computing and cryptography, particularly in their applications to secure communication systems.

## **Research Interests**

My research interests span both **quantum algorithms** and **cryptography**, with a particular focus on quantum algorithms and post-quantum cryptography. I am actively seeking a **Ph.D.** position to further explore these areas and contribute to advancements in quantum technologies and secure systems as we move toward a quantum-powered future.
